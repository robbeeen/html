           <br><li style="font-family: consolas;margin-left: 30px;color: white;"> C Programming
           <p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;">The C programming language is a computer programming language that was developed to do system programming for the operating system UNIX and is an imperative programming language. C was developed in the early 1970s by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
            at Bell Labs. It is a procedural language, which means that people can write their programs as a series of step-by-step instructions. C is a compiled language.<br><br><b>Professor : </b>Dr.Anirban Choudhary</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;"><b>Expectation</b><br><br>The biggest reason to learn C over assembly language is because it's much easier and faster to write code in C than in assembly language for a given programming task. With C,I can write far fewer lines of code, complete
            the job much quicker.</b>
           

            <br><br><li style="font-family: consolas;margin-left: 30px;color: white;">Computer Architecture
            	<p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;">Computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Architecture is decribed as the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.It
            involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.<br><br><b>Professor : </b>Dr.Anoop Tiwari
        </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;"><b>Expectation</b><br><br>The subject explores how machines are designed, built, and operate. Knowing what's inside and how it works will help me design, develop, and implement applications better, faster, cheaper, more efficient, and easier to
            use because i will be able to make informed decisions instead of guestimating and assuming.</p>
           

            <br><br><li style="font-family: consolas;margin-left: 30px;color: white;">Business Communication
            	<p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;">Business communication encompasses topics such as marketing, brand management, customer relations, consumer behavior, advertising, public relations, corporate communication, community engagement, reputation management, interpersonal communication,
            employee engagement, and event management. It is closely related to the fields of professional communication and technical communication.<br><br><b>Professor : </b>Dr.Anjuli Jain</p>
      <p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;"><b>Expectation</b><br><br>A well-rounded business communication course can help oneself understand the power of visual communication, interpret business visuals, and make intelligent design choices in their own documents and presentations. </p>


            <br><br><li style="font-family: consolas;margin-left: 30px;color: white;">Data Structure
            	<p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;">In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the
            functions or operations that can be applied to the data.<br><br><b>Professor : </b>Dr.Amit Bhagat</p>
     <p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;"><b>Expectation</b><br><br>Data structure and algorithms help in understanding the nature of the problem at a deeper level and thereby a better understanding of the world.</p>


            <br><br><li style="font-family: consolas;margin-left: 30px;color: white;">Operting System
            	<p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;">An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts
            as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. <br><br><b>Professor : </b>Dr.Vishnu
            Priya
        </p>
       <p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;"><b>Expectation</b><br><br>Learning OS changes the perception of a coder to a large extent. A good OS concept will increase my value as a coder also. </p><br>


            <br><li style="font-family: consolas;margin-left: 30px;color: white;">Discrete Mathematics
            	<p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;">Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as
            integers, graphs, and statements in logic – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry<br><br><b>Professor : </b>Dr.Manoj
            Jha | Dr.Madhvi Shakya</p>
       <p style="margin-left: 20px;color: maroon;"><b>Expectation</b><br><br>The mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete math, in particular combinatorics and graph theory. This means that in order to learn the fundamental algorithms used by computer programmers,
            i need a solid background in this subjects.</p>
